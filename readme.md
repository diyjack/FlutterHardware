By using these files, you agree to release from all liability and hold harmless Flutter Wireless, its employees, contributors, and representatives. We are not responsible for any errors or ommissions contained herin, and all devices derived from this work should be indepentently verified by an engineer or engineers skilled in the appropriate fields.

The devices described by these files are wireless devices classified as intentional radiators. The electromagnetic spectrum used by these devices is a shared medium that is regulated by all governments worldwide. If you produce your own copies of these boards, you must comply with all local wireless regulations including but not limited to passing wireless certification tests. Flutter Wireless has performed wireless testing to permit us to distribute this hardware in various regions, but this certification is exclusive to Flutter Wireless and does not extend to third party manufacturers. It is your responsibility to know the laws and ensure that devices you produce follow them.

It should also be noted that open source radio products are a new phenomenon. So far the law permits them, but there is a risk that new legal restrictions could be passed that harm the open source community if users abuse this hardware by producing versions of this or other hardware that violate the law. Be respectful and responsible - don't make changes that you don't understand or that violate the law. None of this should be considered legal advice - just common sense.
